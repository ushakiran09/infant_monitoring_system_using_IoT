# infant_monitoring_system_using_IoT
infant monitoring system belongs to the domain of IoT which helps in monitoring the infants 
The system requires the following components:
1 sound sensor
2 temperature sensor
3 moisture sensor
4 GSM Module
5 Arduino Uno (2)
6 Speaker, jumper wires.....
all the sensors along with the gsm module are connected to a arduino and the code gsm original_copy is fed
the speaker is connected to other arduino which takes input from sound sensor and the code sound arduino_copy is fed to this arduino

This completes the set up and the sound temperature and moisture alert are sent to the given phone number via GSM module when the respective stimlus is detected
